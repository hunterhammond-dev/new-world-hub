             With excitement increasing about the beta and full release of Amazon Game Studios Action MMORPG fans of the unreleased game are getting more and more anxious to get their hand on information about the content they can participate in. On April 9th, 2020, the developers released information on a gameplay mechanic known as invasions. In these events, players will be able to fight the corrupted army, one of the game's enemy factions, in the form of waves. While each wave gets increasingly more difficult, a group of players must defend a Fort that has been built by the players. Although players have much to gain from withstanding all waves (in the form of rewards), there is also much to lose. If players are not able to repel the corrupted, the fort that was being invaded can lose many player-created resources like crafting stations, shops, and fortifications.<br><br>
             We will see many different enemies in invasions, however, they will be similar to what we see in the wilds of Aeternum. The corrupted waves are composed of 6 different types of enemies; grunts, raiders, snipers, bombers, brutes, and bosses. Grunts are going to be the most common as they are easier to kill compared to the rest. Players still have to be careful around them though as they tend to swarm and use the “power in number” mentality. Raiders are some of the most skilled beings in this army, they have trained and practiced their craft of killing. Raiders are going to be forced to be reckoned with. Snipers are exactly what they sound like. They will use tools that allow them to kill players from a distance, using cover and quick maneuvers to trick players. Bombers are corrupted with explosive bundles on their back, the bombers main focus will be fortifications and artillery made by players. Brutes will have to be taken down by groups of players as they have an enormous amount of health. Additionally, they will try to single out players that attack them solo. Finally, the mob that people are most excited about, bosses. I have a feeling that bosses are going to have the biggest impact on whether a player will be able to survive or not. Bosses will change from wave to wave and players will have to use different tactics to defeat each one.<br><br>

             Invasions will consist of 50 players to defend. The first 10 slots are reserved by the governor of that territory, the governor chooses these players based on who they believe will be the best defender for that territory. The other 40 slots are players that signed up for this specific invasion the day before. These players are selected randomly, the only condition is that players are level 50 or higher. Along with the sheer amount of adventures that can participate in invasions, players will have access to many different types of tools to aid their defense. These will include turrets, droppers, and traps, just to name a few. Each of these tools will have stronger variants that can be upgraded before invasions. Along with support tools, players will also have buffs that they can apply, some are personal buffs and others are buffs that can be applied to an entire team.<br><br>
             For MMORPGs, this is a new concept that has many players excited. There is tons of room for metas and dynamically changing landscapes because of invasions. Just like everyone in this community, here at New World Hub, we are excited about this announcement and this game in general. So stay tuned for more updates about this game.<br><br>
